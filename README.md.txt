Road Accident Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing road accident data to identify patterns, risk factors, and trends across time, location, road conditions, and vehicle types.
The goal is to support data-driven road safety decisions using clear and insightful visual analytics.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze accident and casualty trends over time
Identify high-risk road types and locations
Understand accident severity distribution
Compare urban vs rural accident impact
Study effects of light, weather, and road conditions

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop
Microsoft Excel
DAX

Git & GitHub (Git LFS for large files)

📊 Key Insights
🚗 Cars contribute the highest number of casualties
🛣️ Single carriageways have the most accidents
🌆 Urban areas account for ~65% of total casualties
☀️ Daytime accidents are significantly higher than night
⚠️ Fatal casualties reduced compared to the previous year

📈 Dashboard Features

KPI cards for total accidents & casualties
Casualties by vehicle type
Monthly trend comparison (Current Year vs Previous Year)
Urban vs Rural distribution
Road type & light condition analysis
Interactive slicers for weather & road surface
